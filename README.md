# COMP 426 A04: Utilizing Third-Party APIs

This assignment utilizes two APIs from TextCortex. You can read the documentation [here](https://docs.textcortex.com/api). Specifically, I made use of the [social media post API](https://docs.textcortex.com/api/paths/texts-social-media-posts/post) and the [ad API](https://docs.textcortex.com/api/paths/texts-ads/post). My API keys have been omitted; you can make an account on TextCortex and then generate your own API key for free to make the application work.

The application uses both of these APIs to generate content based on user input. The user can choose to create a social media post to either Twitter (now known as "X," I suppose) or LinkedIn that includes and talks about one or more keywords. They can also choose to generate an advertisement for a real or fictional product given the product's name, a brief description of the product, and one or more keywords to include in the ad.

The application is pretty barebones; there isn't much to it other than three webpages (a home page, a page for generating posts, and a page for generating ads) and the use of the APIs. I opted not to create any CSS files for this assignment since it wasn't mentioned to be required.
